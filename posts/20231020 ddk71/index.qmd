知不知上, 不知知病.\
\
夫唯病病, 是以不病,\
聖人不病, 以其病病, 是以不病.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

알고도 알지 못함은 좋지만 알지 못하면서 안다고 여기는 것은 병이다.\
\
무릇 병을 병이라 여기면 문제가 되지 않는것이다.\
성인이 문제가 없는 것은 병을 병이라 여기기 때문이다.\

"Knowing what you don't know is the essence of true knowledge;

Not knowing what you don't know is a disease.

Only when one recognizes the existence of a disease can one avoid falling ill.

The Sage is not ill because he recognizes the disease, thus avoiding falling ill."

Chat GPT Version

Knowing that you do not know is the best.

Not knowing that you do not know is an illness.

\
Truly, only those who see illness as illness

Can avoid illness.

The sage is not ill,

Because he sees illness as illness.

Therefore he is not ill.
